An end-to-end ML Recommender System

### Design principle
This ML system consists of _3_ major pipelines: 
1. Feature Pipeline
2. Training Pipeline
3. Inference Pipeline

All of the above integrate and interact with each other through a central _Feature Store_.

Inspired by
- Building ML Systems with a Feature Store, Jim Dowling, O'Reilly Media, (2025)
